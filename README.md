Object Detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once)
Overview

The Object Detection using YOLO project is a practical implementation and exploration of state-of-the-art computer vision techniques for real-time object detection. YOLO, which stands for "You Only Look Once," is a popular deep learning algorithm that can detect and classify objects in images and video streams with impressive speed and accuracy. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in understanding, implementing, and fine-tuning YOLO for various object detection tasks.
